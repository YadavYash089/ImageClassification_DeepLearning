# ImageClassification_DeepLearning
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to.
This project showcases an image classification system using deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), capable of identifying various object categories with high accuracy. It integrates a user-friendly GUI made with the Python library Tkinter, allowing users to easily upload and classify images in real-time. The project demonstrates the power of CNNs in practical applications.
